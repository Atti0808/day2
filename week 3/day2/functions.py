#paramaters are in round brackets()
#function call is when invoking a code
#the space in parameters are filled with arguments
#argument is the variable
#def = defines a function , if the function has paramaters we can label those paramaters

# def say_hello():
#     print("Szia") #<- body of the function , what is output to our user

# say_hello()  #<- it`s used by calling it , `  
#pass - helps us skipp the body of the function until the final version is ready

# def is the keyword needed to let Python know you will be definin a new function
#functions should be well name for readability. Functions always end with ()- even if we`re not giving it parameters
